Introduction to the problem
#New York City is a multicultural melting pot with people from different nationalities, each one has established themselves around the city creating communities that have their own culture, traditions and food. 
#According to the CLACLS (Online: https://clacls.gc.cuny.edu/files/2017/03/Latino-Data-Project-Report-65.-The-Latino-Population-of-New-York-City-1990-2015.-December-2016.pdfhttps://clacls.gc.cuny.edu/files/2017/03/Latino-Data-Project-Report-65.-The-Latino-Population-of-New-York-City-1990-2015.-December-2016.pdf)
•	Mexicans were the third largest Latino national subgroup in the City and increased from 58,000 and 3% of all Latinos in 1990 to 377,000 and 15% of the New York’s Hispanic population in 2015. Between 1990 and 2010 Mexicans had been the fastest growing Latino nationality but growth, and probably migration to the City, slowed considerably after 2010.
•	Mexicans were concentrated in Queens where 31% lived, Brooklyn 30%, and Manhattan 22%.
•	Latinos were the youngest of all race/ethnic groups in the City with a median age of 33 in 2015. Mexicans were the youngest of the Latino nationalities with a median age of 26 followed by Dominicans at 32, Ecuadorians at 33, Puerto Ricans, 37, and Colombians at 41.
Considering this a client has approached me so as to help him decide in what area of the city would be a good place to open an authentic Mexican Restaurant where he could exploit the ethnic characteristics of different areas in the city so as to gain the most clients that would create more revenue to his endeavor.

Data:
The data that would be used will be NYC demographics:
